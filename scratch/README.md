# Scratch

To make scratch work with the GPIOs, we have to use scratch's mesh network function. You can see the instructions to enable this on the scratch webpage:

Unfortunately, it's rather complicated to setup!

Once it's mesh enabled, you can run a "listener" program written in python. This program connects to scratch and allows scratch to then control the GPIOs.

# Connections

add an LED and a resistor in series to pin 8 of the header. There is an example circuit on the workshop resources.
