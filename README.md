# Raspberry Pi workshop resources

examples of basic IO, servos, steppers, twitter etc. for the raspberry pi.

# Pre-requisites

A few libraries and external programs are required for running all the code. To setup a pi (not just the libraries, but things like hostnames and led heartbeats) you can run the ./configuration/provision.sh as root from the pi. 

Otherwise, take a look at the libraries installed by the provision.sh shell script
