# sending an email

We can use a python library called smtplib to send an email via gmail. You can read more about the library here:

    http://docs.python.org/2/library/smtplib.html

To use the demo, you'll need to change the gmail username and password at the top, and then change the recipient's email address at the bottom of the file.
